title: About me
---

My name is Annika Valaboju. I am a student at Michigan State University, currently pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science. With a strong focus in software systems and development, I have developed an interest in building complex and innovative projects. 

My coursework and foundational skills have aided me in gaining the proper hands-on experience in computer science. I have had the opportunity to apply these skills in real-world scenarios through coursework and projects. These roles have allowed me to collaborate with my peers, improve decision-making abilities, and has given me opportunities to learn different coding languages.
