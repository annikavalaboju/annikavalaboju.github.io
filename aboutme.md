My name is Annika Valaboju. I am a student at Michigan State University, currently pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science. With a strong focus in software systems and development, I have developed an interest in building complex and innovative projects.  

My coursework and foundational skills have aided me in gaining the proper hands-on experience in computer science. I have had the opportunity to apply these skills in real-world scenarios through coursework and projects. These roles have allowed me to collaborate with my peers, improve decision-making abilities, and has given me opportunities to learn different coding languages. 

My programming journey began early, and the interest has lasted me well into my academic career. I find solving complex problems and continuously learning new technologies and methodologies interesting. This way, I am able to refine my skills and make meaningful contributions, and apply this knowledge and enthusiasm in professional settings.
